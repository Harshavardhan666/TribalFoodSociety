                    <p>Traditionally the Gadwas, Gonds and Dhurwas tribes of Chhattisgarh practice the Dokra art with lost wax technique or hollow casting. It involves patterning a clay core intricately with wax ribbons and then coating it carefully with
                        a mix of clay and hay. The wax is subsequently melted off, and the cavity formed is filled with molten metal - an alloy of copper and tin. When this solidifies, the craftsman reveals the beauty of his creation by cautiously breaking
                        open the outer clay shell. Inspiration for casting unique pieces of art comes from the abundant environment, be it the village ghotul, myriad of trees, birds and animals, mythology or rituals. Tribes offers a breathtaking range
                        of metal craft created by the deft hands of the tribal artisans of Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha & West Bengal.

                    <p>Cane and Bamboo is abundantly found in almost all the North Eastern States of India. The tribal inhabitants make utility products like basketry, which are woven in various patterns, shapes and sizes. The baskets are traditionally Conical,
                        Flat bottomed or Flat Cylindrical and are used for carrying firewood, water, storing grains or straining rice beer beside other variety of fishing utility baskets. Cane and Bamboo is also used in making other utility items like
                        trays, lamps, fruit baskets, key rings, walking sticks, Office bags, pen stands & a range of furniture products. Sofa Sets, chairs, dinning/conference table, laundry baskets, waste baskets etc. are many forms of intricately carved
                        cane & Bamboo products that can handle lot of usage without getting damaged.</p>
                    <p>It is eco friendly as the same is made from a renewable forest resource. The manufacturing process of cane furniture starts with the preparation of requisite amount of bamboo slips. Canes of various diameters are also reduced into
                        slips of various sizes according to adaptability. The artisans then prepare a rough structure of the furniture by joining the different bamboo parts with the help of nails. In case of round-cane furniture, thin iron rods are used
                        to get the round cane bend to the required shape. The actual weaving or coiling of the structure so made is done with fine slips of flexible cane. Cane & Bamboo is one of the main source of income for Chakma, Dimasa, Nagas, Mizos,
                        Khasi, Garo Jaintias, Riyang Apatani, tribes from Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal & Tripura.</p>

                    <p>Longpi pottery, also known as Longpi Ham, is not only a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Tangkhul Naga tribe but also a thriving art form that has gained recognition worldwide. The exquisite black stone pottery produced
                        in Longpi is steeped in tradition and carries with it the stories and skills passed down through generations. The process of crafting Longpi pottery is a labor-intensive and time-honored tradition. Skilled artisans from the Tangkhul
                        Naga tribe have honed their craft over years of practice, creating functional and aesthetically pleasing pieces. Unlike conventional pottery, Longpi pottery doesn't rely on a potter's wheel. Instead, it relies on the dexterity
                        of the potter's hands and the use of molds to shape the clay.</p>
                    <p>The raw materials for Longpi pottery are derived from the local soil, which contains a unique combination of weathered rock and serpentine, giving the pottery its distinctive gray-black color. This natural clay mixture is eco-friendly
                        and sustainable, making Longpi pottery an environmentally conscious choice for those who appreciate handmade artistry. The Longpi pottery repertoire has expanded over time to include a diverse range of products. Beyond the classic
                        cooking pots, kettles, bowls, and mugs, artisans have embraced innovation by creating contemporary pieces like table lamps, candlestick holders, and office collectibles. These new additions not only showcase the versatility of
                        the craft but also cater to a global audience seeking unique and artistic home decor. What truly sets Longpi pottery apart is its minimalistic yet elegant design. The pieces often feature a sleek black background with understated
                        motifs. This aesthetic not only makes them practical for everyday use but also seamlessly integrates the cultural and artistic heritage of the Tangkhul Naga tribe into modern living spaces.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, Longpi pottery has transcended geographical boundaries. It has found appreciative audiences in countries like Australia, Sweden, Germany, and the United States, where people value its craftsmanship and the cultural
                        story it carries. The global recognition of Longpi pottery not only supports the livelihoods of the artisans but also helps preserve a unique heritage that might otherwise be lost in the annals of time.</p>
